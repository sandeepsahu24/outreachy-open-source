Outreachy week 9: Assignments for mentors & interns

Welcome to week nine of your Outreachy internship! Now is a good time to start thinking about your career path after the Outreachy internship.

We have some goals and assignments for both mentors and interns. Please read the sections below.

Week 9 Theme
------------

The theme for this week is "Career opportunities".

Some Outreachy interns may not know what they want to do with their career. Other Outreachy interns may be switching careers, and not know how to break into a new field. There may be Outreachy interns who took time off from their career to raise kids, and want to get back to work.

It's important to talk to your mentor, coordinators, and Outreachy organizers about what career opportunities are possible. We encourage you to talk to your mentor about what career options you would like to explore.

Your goal for this week's blog post is to write a post about what direction you want your career to go. You may want to wait to publish the post until after you participate in the intern chat, since your goals might change!

Week 9 Mentor & Intern Chat
----------------------------

For this chat, we're also inviting past Outreachy interns to participate!

On {{ current_round.week_ten_chat_text_date }} UTC we will host a chat for Outreachy interns, alums, and mentors:

{{ current_round.week_ten_career_chat_url }}

We'll be discussing all the different ways you can advance your career by participating in free software. The discussion will have two parts.

The first part of the discussion will be everyone brainstorming different career paths in the technology industry and free software. Many people have part-time or full-time jobs working in the technology industry. Some people may be self-employed contractors, paid to work on free software. People may have taken a while to find a job. They may have participated in other internship programs, volunteer opportunities, grants, or networked at conferences and events.

We encourage everyone to share their stories of how they advanced their career. What did you try that didn't work? Where did you hear about opportunities? How did you network and connect with people who helped you advance your goals?

The second part of the discussion is brainstorming additional opportunities to work on free software. We encourage both mentors and interns to provide information about paid opportunities, but information about unpaid opportunities is also welcome. Sharing information about resource groups or job posting boards is also encouraged.

After the chat, you can help Outreachy organizers spread the word about these opportunities. You can update the Outreachy website opportunities page by sending a GitHub pull request:

Goals for Mentors
-----------------

Week 9 goals:

 - Talk to your intern about any opportunities to continue working in your community
 - Ask your network about jobs, grants, or other opportunities to share during the chat

Goals for Interns
-----------------

Week 9 goals:

 - Talk to your mentor about ways you can continue working in the community
 - Participate in the career chat
 - Write a blog post about your career goals

Week 9 Blog
-----------

For this week's blog post, we'd like to write about what your career goals are. If you aren't looking for a job or internship, you can talk about what volunteer opportunities you'd like to participate in. If you're looking for a opportunity in the future, make sure to include when you'll be available.

Here's some prompts that could get you started writing this blog post:

 - Are you looking for a job, internship, a grant, a volunteer position, or some type of other opportunity?
 - What types of work would you like to contribute to?
 - What tools or skills do you have that would help you with that work?
 - What tools or skills would you like to learn?
 - What interpersonal skills make you a collaborative team member?
 - What languages do you speak, and at what school grade level?

You might also want to talk about how your identity or background will allow you to provide a unique perspective on a team. Companies often want a diverse set of perspectives in their teams. A team with people who have all the same background makes products that don't fit everyone's needs. Please only share what you're comfortable with being public on the internet!

If you're looking for a job opportunity, here's some additional things you might want to mention:

 - When are you available to start work? (This should be after your Outreachy internship ends, including if you have an extension.)
 - Are you able to move, and if so, which countries/regions are you willing to move to?
 - Are you looking for a remote job? (Hint, saying you already have three months experience as a remote intern will help you find another remote position!)
 - Are you looking for a full-time or part-time paid position?
 - Are you open to being a self-employed contractor?

Social media promotion
---

Once you've written your blog post, we encourage you to share it on Twitter. Please include the Twitter account of your community. Please also include Outreachy's Twitter account (@outreachy). The Outreachy Twitter account will retweet your blog post. This may help you find people to help you with your career goals.

It's important to write a tweet that encourages people to take a particular action. In this case, the action you want people to take is to help you further your career goal (not just read your blog post).

Let's look at good example of how to promote your career blog post. Look at this tweet from a past Outreachy intern, Eduar Tua:

https://twitter.com/eduartua/status/1113594223562035200

This tweet is good at promoting Eduar's career goals because:

1. It mentions what career goal Eduar wants: "I'm looking for a job"
2. It mentions where Eduar is willing to live to meet his career goal: "I'm based in Mexico but willing to relocate"
3. It mentions specific things Eduar would like to work on during his career: "Golang, Kubernetes, Linux, Web Development"
4. It mentions an action people can take: "If you know someone who is hiring, let me know"
5. It mentions what Eduar was working on during his Outreachy internship: "revamping de @kubernetesio developers guide"
6. It tags social media handles of Outreachy (@outreachy) and the community Eduar worked with (@kubernetesio)

While Eduar didn't include a link to a blog post about his career goals, we encourage you to link to your blog post.

Don't stress too much about getting your social media post or blog post perfect. It's better to get the information out there and make connections than to spend too much time perfecting your blog post. We don't recommend spending more than 1 to 3 hours on your blog post.

If you have any questions, please contact the Outreachy organizers organizers@outreachy.org
