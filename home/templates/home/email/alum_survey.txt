Help Outreachy by taking the 2018 longitudinal survey

Hi {{ name }},

Outreachy needs your help to make our fundraiser awesome! Outreachy is running a fundraiser in July, and we want to show the world what kind of impact Outreachy has on our past interns.

You can help us provide statistics about Outreachy alums by taking a survey about how your Outreachy internship impacted your life and your passion for FOSS. According to our records, you were an Outreachy intern for {{ community }} in the {{ internstarts|date:"F Y" }} to {{ internends|date:"F Y" }} Outreachy internship round. We want to know how your Outreachy internship impacted you.

Please take the 10 minute survey: {{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'longitudinal-survey-2018' survey_slug=token %}

As a thank you for filling out the longitudinal survey, we'll mail you an Outreachy sticker. Just provide your address at the end of the survey. (If you don't want a sticker, that's fine, just leave the address fields blank.)

p.s. If you don't want us to contact you with any future longitudinal surveys, you can opt-out here: {{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'longitudinal-survey-2018-opt-out' survey_slug=token %}
