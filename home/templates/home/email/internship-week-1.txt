Outreachy week 1: Assignments for mentors & interns

Welcome to the first week of your Outreachy internship! We're happy to support you through this journey.

This is the first of several messages Outreachy organizers will send throughout the internship period. Each message will have a section for interns and a section for mentors. We hope this transparency provides better understanding of expectations and goals for both parties and ultimately creates a successful internship!

Please read the sections below to ensure that the first internship feedback (due on {{ current_round.initialfeedback }}) is successful. Contact us at organizers@outreachy.org anytime with questions or comments.

Internship chats
----------------

Every two weeks during the internship, interns, mentors, coordinators, and Outreachy organizers have a chat on the Outreachy Zulip server. The chat schedule is here:

{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'docs-internship' %}#chats

The first internship chat will take place on {{ current_round.week_two_chat_text_date|date:"D M d, Y" }} {{ current_round.week_two_chat_text_date|time:"H:i" }} UTC on {{ current_round.week_two_chat_text_url }}

Both interns and mentors should attend this first chat.
