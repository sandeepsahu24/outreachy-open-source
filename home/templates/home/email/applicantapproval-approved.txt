Next Steps
---

The next step is to pick one or two projects, talk to the project mentors, and make a contribution to the project. You make a contribution by completing a project task. A contribution could be something like fixing a bug in the project code or updating the project's documentation.

Only applicants who make a contribution will be eligible to be accepted as an Outreachy intern. We encourage you to start making on your contributions as soon as possible! The contribution period starts on {{ application.application_round.contributions_open }} at 4pm UTC. Contributions and final applications are due on {{ application.application_round.contributions_close }} at 4pm UTC.

Contacting Mentors
---

Mentors will not be assigned to you. You'll need to pick a project and contact the mentor. Many applicants are shy and prefer to contact mentors via email. However, you can often get your questions answered faster if you ask them on the community chat or forums.

It's important for you be in contact with the project mentor during the whole contribution period. Ask questions about the project description. Introduce yourself on the community chat or forums as an Outreachy applicant. If the project description isn't clear, ask how you can make your first contribution.

Make sure to reach out to the project mentor if you're stuck for more than a couple hours. Update your mentor with what you're working on and what progress you've made at least twice a week. Mentors are looking for applicants who have clear and consistent communication skills.
