<h2 id='what-is-outreachy'><a href="#what-is-outreachy">What is Outreachy?</a></h2>

<p>Outreachy is an internship program. Outreachy internships are:</p>

<p class="ml-4 mb-0">üíµ <b>Paid</b> - $6,000 USD total internship stipend</p>

<p class="ml-4 my-0">üåç <b>Remote</b> - both interns and mentors work remotely</p>

<p class="ml-4 mt-0">üï∞ <b>3 months</b> - internships run {{ current_round.internstarts|date:"F d" }} to {{ current_round.internends|date:"F d" }}</p>

<p>Outreachy's goal is to increase <b>diversity in open source</b>. Past Outreachy interns are:</p>

<p class="ml-4 mb-0">‚ôÄÔ∏è 92% women</li>
<p class="ml-4 my-0">üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà 4% transgender, genderqueer, or non-binary people</p>
<p class="ml-4 my-0">üßïüèæ 64% people of color</p>
<p class="ml-4 mt-0">üßëüèø 12% people from a historically disadvantaged caste or tribe</p>

<p><i>Statistics are based on responses to the 2019 longitudinal study of Outreachy alums.</i></p>

<h2 id='mentor-duties'><a href='#mentor-duties'>Mentor duties</a></h2>

<p>The heart of Outreachy is our volunteer mentors. Mentors work directly with Outreachy applicants and interns.</p>

<p>Outreachy looks for mentors who are <i>helpful, patient, welcoming, and kind</i>.</p>

<p>
<b>Mentor time commitment:</b>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>{{ current_round.contributions_open|date:"F j" }} to {{ current_round.contributions_close|date:"F j" }}: Mentors spend <b>5 to 10 hours per week</b> during the applicant contribution period.</li>
	<li>{{ current_round.internstarts|date:"F j" }} to {{ current_round.internends|date:"F j" }}: Mentors spend <b>5 hours per week</b> during the internship period.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mentors will need to provide an internship project description. Outreachy does not allow applicants to submit project ideas.</p>

<p>It is okay for mentors to submit multiple project ideas. Communities with sponsorship for one intern tend to list 1 to 3 projects. Some communities list as many as 5 to 7 projects.</p>

<p>Outreachy encourages co-mentoring! Co-mentoring is when two or more people mentor the same Outreachy intern.</p>

<p>Mentors will need to provide a list of tasks for applicants to work on during the contribution period.</p>
