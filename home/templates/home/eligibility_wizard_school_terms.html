<h2>School Term Dates</h2>


<p>Outreachy needs to know the school term dates for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>your <b>current</b> school term</li>
	<li>your <b>next</b> school term</li>
	<li>the school term <b>following</b> your next school term</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Uncertain term dates</b></p>

<p>Some universities may not have released the schedule for future terms. In this case, use the dates from past academic calendars. Use the most recent calendar available for that term.</p>

<p><b>Applying to universities</b></p>

<p>
If you are applying to universities and colleges, Outreachy needs to know your approximate school term dates. You can update your initial application if you find out what school you are accepted to. For now, use the academic calendar from the university you are most likely to be accepted at.
</p>

<p><b>Graduating students</b></p>

<p>If one of these school terms is your last term before graduation, check 'This is the last term in my degree' on that school term. If you will continue onto another degree after your graduation, make sure to fill in the remaining school terms. If you are switching to another university, note which university the school term is associated with.</p>

<p><b>Masters and PhD students</b></p>

<p>
If you are enrolled in classes, use your school's academic calendar, and the instructions below.
</p>

<p>
If you are working on your thesis, you may not be enrolled in school classes. Outreachy counts thesis research and writing as a "school term".
</p>

<p>
Fill in the date classes start as today's date. Fill in the date exams end as your thesis defense date. If your thesis defense is not scheduled, use the approximate date your thesis defense would be scheduled for.
</p>

<p>
If you will take a break from thesis work over a school vacation period, then use multiple school terms.
Set the date exams end of one school term to be the start of the school vacation.
Set the date classes start of the next school term to be the end of the school vacation.
</p>

					<p>
					Some schools have activities before the first day of classes. Those activities could be things like new student week or moving into a student dormitory. Do not use the start date of those activities.
					</p>

					<p>
					Some students start classes on different dates. In that case, use the date classes start for your group of students. For example, 5th semester students may start classes on a different date than 7th semester students. If you are a 5th semester student, use the date classes start for 5th semester students.

					<p>
					You must use the class start dates in your university academic calendar. Some universities allow students to join classes after their official start date. However, please use the class dates listed in your academic calendar. Outreachy cannot accept a letter from your university about late enrollment.
