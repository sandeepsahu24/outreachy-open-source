	<p>Your initial application for Outreachy has been approved. You are approved to move onto the Outreachy contribution period.
	</p>
	<p>
	The contribution period runs from {{ role.current_round.contributions_open }} to {{ role.current_round.contributions_close }} at 4pm UTC.
	During the contribution phase, applicants complete Outreachy project tasks.
	A completed or in-progress project task is called a contribution.
	Submitting that project task for review by mentors is called making a contribution.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>You must make a contribution to be eligible for the internship.</b>
	Some projects will have instructions for how to make your first contributions.
	For other projects, you will need to contact the mentor to get directions on how to make your first contributions.
	</p>
	<p>
	We encourage you to <a href='{% url 'docs' %}'>read our documentation</a>.
	The <a href='{% url 'docs-applicant' %}'>Applicant Guide</a> has tips for being successful during the contribution period.
	The <a href='{% url 'docs-internship' %}'>Internship Guide</a> has information about the intern payment schedule.

	<p>We're sorry, but your initial application was not accepted.
	This may be due to one of two reasons:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>You may not be eligible to be paid as a contractor of a non-profit based in the United States of America. This could be due to you not being eligible to work in all the countries you are living in during your internship, you being a legal minor (under 18), visa restrictions, U.S. sanctions programs, or U.S. export restrictions.</li>
		<li>You were a Google Summer of Code intern, an Outreachy intern, or an intern with the Outreach Program for Women.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	Some applicants may have provided incorrect information that caused their application to be rejected.
	Due to the large number of applications we receive, we are not able to make corrections to applications.

	<h2>Can I contest this result?</h2>
	<p>
	The Outreachy program put full-time commitment checking place
	in order to ensure that both interns and mentors have a good experience.
	Based on our past experience, interns with full-time commitments,
	especially school time commitments, are less likely to have successful internships.
	</p>
	<p>
	In the December 2014 - March 2015 Outreachy internship round, we had 19
	interns who had classes during the majority of the internship time.
	Two interns failed, two interns had to extend their internship by 2 weeks,
	five interns had to extend their internships by 2 to 5 weeks.
	</p>
	<p>
	Consequently, there was a 37% chance that the organization, mentor, and
	intern will have a poor experience if an applicant who is full-time in
	school is accepted. A poor internship experience typically means that
	the Outreachy mentor chooses not to participate in the program again.
	</p>
	<p>
	Outreachy has had a significant drop in the number of failures and
	internship extensions since we implemented the full-time commitment
	policies.
	</p>
	<p>
	<strong>The Outreachy organizers are very firm about
		the eligibility rules around time commitment requirements.</strong>
	We cannot accept letters to excuse students from class work or late class enrollment letters.
	We cannot accept manager approval for an employee to work for less than the hours in their employment contract.
	We cannot allow students from schools in the Northern Hemisphere to participate in the December to March round.
	We cannot allow students from schools in the Southern Hemisphere to participate in the May to August round.
	We follow the term dates listed in official school calendars, and we cannot make exceptions.
	</p>
	<p>
	We hope your time commitments change in the future such that you
	are eligible to apply for Outreachy.
