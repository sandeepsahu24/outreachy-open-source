/* A participation request can at any time be in one of five states.
 *
 * Various submitters need to apply to participate at various levels,
 * and are reviewed by a level of approvers above them.
 *
 * - Unknown: No request received yet.
 * - Pending: Request received and awaiting review.
 * - Withdrawn: Cancelled by submitter.
 * - Rejected: Cancelled by approver.
 * - Approved: Permitted by approver.
 *
 * For community coordinators, "submitter" is the coordinator applicant,
 * and "approver" is either the Outreachy organizers or existing
 * coordinators already approved for the community.
 *
 * For community participation in the current round, "submitter" is
 * anyone who has been approved as a coordinator for this community, and
 * "approver" is the Outreachy organizers. The user who created a
 * community is automatically approved as a coordinator for that
 * community so they can withdraw or edit it while waiting for review.
 * Editing information about both the community and its participation in
 * the current round is restricted to "submitter".
 *
 * For projects, "submitter" is any approved mentor for the project, and
 * "approver" is any approved coordinator for the community. The user
 * who created a project is automatically approved as a mentor for that
 * project so they can withdraw or edit it while waiting for review.
 * Editing information about the project is restricted to "submitter".
 *
 * For mentors, "submitter" is the mentor applicant, and "approver" is
 * any approved coordinator for the community. We choose not to allow
 * existing approved mentors to act as approver for mentor requests
 * because we want community coordinators to impose consistent standards
 * on all their mentors. Editing information about the mentor is
 * restricted to "submitter".
 *
 * Under various circumstances, a person may be both a "submitter" and
 * an "approver" for the same request, such as if a community
 * coordinator is also a mentor. In that case we only offer them the
 * higher-priviledge "approver" options.
