# Outreachy PLC members

Outreachy has a Project Level Committee (PLC) that meets to make major decisions about program changes, solve complex issues, and discuss financial decisions.

The duties of an Outreachy PLC member are:

   1. *Be responsive to any email that starts with the subject "[Outreachy
   PLC]"*. Typically PLC members respond to emails within 1-2 weeks. Any
   email requiring a more prompt response will have the subject line URGENT,
   and will typically have a due date in the subject. Some emails may have
   individual PLC member names in the subject line (e.g. because we're missing
   a vote from that member). Please respond within 3-5 days to any email with
   your name in the subject line.

   2. *Attend a 1 hour Outreachy PLC meeting once a month*. It's okay to
   miss a meeting, but PLC members should let us know beforehand that they
   can't attend, or send a follow up email afterwards.

   3. *Prioritize responding to Outreachy PLC email.* Attending Outreachy
   PLC meetings is less important than being responsive over email. Notes from
   all PLC meetings will be sent to the Outreachy PLC. Anyone who missed a
   meeting is welcome to respond to any topic via email.

Current Outreachy PLC member list:

 - Karen Sandler
 - Tony Sebro
 - Sage Sharp
 - Marina Zhurakhinskaya

There is one Outreachy PLC member who is the representative for Outreachy to the Software Freedom Conservancy. They communicate any financial decisions the Outreachy PLC makes to Conservancy (e.g. approved expenses, conference sponsorship, etc).

The Outreachy PLC representative must not have a financial conflict of interest. Sage Sharp cannot be the representative, because they are paid to work on Outreachy.

The current Outreachy PLC representative is Marina Zhurakhinskaya.

# Outreachy PLC rules

The Outreachy PLC agreement was signed on January 30, 2015 by Marina Zhurakhinskaya. The file can be found in the private Outreachy organizer GitLab repo, under the file contacts/Outreachy-PLC-agreement-final-signed-MZ.pdf

## Minimum Number of PLC members

Outreachy by-laws specify that there must be at least three Outreachy PLC members.

## Adding Outreachy PLC members

Outreachy by-laws under the Software Freedom Conservancy say that a majority of employees from one company cannot be PLC members. So if one employee from company A is already on the Outreachy PLC, and everyone else works for a different company, another employee from Company A cannot join the Outreachy PLC.

## Removing Outreachy PLC members

Members can be removed by a simple majority vote.
