Receiving E-Mail

Outreachy may send you e-mail about your account, to inform you of important upcoming Outreachy events, or in response to your questions.

Outreachy processes your personal data in these cases to fulfill and comply with its contractual obligations to you, to provide the services you have requested, and to ensure the security of your account. 

Outreachy manages several mailing lists. The subscriber list is hidden from other subscribers, so your e-mail information will not be shared unless you post to the list.

You can unsubscribe from any of these lists directly through the mailing list website.


The Outreachy website sends automated e-mails to applicants who have filled out an initial application, mentors, and coordinators. By signing up to participate in the program, you agree to receive notification e-mails at the e-mail address listed in your account. We are working to allow Outreachy website users to opt-out of e-mail notifications in the future.

Outreachy often makes chat rooms and mailing lists available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. Exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal data. Although we value individual ideas and encourage free expression, Outreachy reserves the right to take necessary action to preserve the integrity of these areas, such as removing any posting that is vulgar, inappropriate, or found to be in violation of our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/outreachy/website/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). It is in Outreachy’s legitimate business interests to provide all users an accurate record of data and content provided in the public forums it maintains and uses; to maintain the integrity of that data and content for historical, scientific, and research purposes; and to provide an environment for the free exchange of ideas relevant and constructive to the development and propagation of open source software. 
 
Our Commitment to Children's Online Privacy
===

Out of special concern for children's privacy, Outreachy does not knowingly accept online personal information from children under the age of 13. Outreachy does not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to get an account on our sites. Outreachy does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information about children under 13. 

In the event that Outreachy ever decides to expand its intended site audience to include children under the age of 13, those specific web pages will, in accordance with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), be clearly identified and provide an explicit privacy notice addressed to children under 13. In addition, Outreachy will provide an appropriate mechanism to obtain parental approval, allow parents to subsequently make changes to or request removal of their children's personal information, and provide access to any other information as required by law.
