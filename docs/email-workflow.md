Background
---

This document describes how the email notifications for the Outreachy website
work for Outreachy organizers, coordinators, and mentors.

Each section describes how a particular role experiences email notifications.
Each section has a list of emails that will be sent.

Email sending is triggered when a Django object that inherits from the
ApprovalStatus class changes approval status. See participation.dot for a
description of the submitter and approver roles and the allowed state changes
for approval status.

We also want to ensure that coordinators and mentors are subscribed to the
mentors and announcements mailing lists. But since mentors start out as approved
for new Projects (so that they can edit them), mentors shouldn't be added to the
mailing list until both their Project and their community's Participation are
approved. Similarly, Coordinators start out as approved if they create a new
Community, so they should not be added to the mailing list until their Community
has at least one approved Participation in a round.

We don't currently have an automated way to manage list subscriptions, because
the rules for incrementally adding people to the list at the right time really
complicated the following description of email workflow. Instead we've adopted
the approach of generating a list of everyone who should be subscribed, feeding
that list to Mailman all at once, and letting Mailman skip anyone who was
already subscribed. Someday perhaps we'll automate feeding the list from one
place to the other, but for the moment that step is still manual.
