Background
---

The Outreachy community and mentor sign-up process currently involves too much manual labor
for Outreachy organizers. In order to allocate organizer time towards expanding the program,
working with applicants, and finding additional funding, we need to automate this process.

Updating Project Listings is Tedious
===

A year ago, we switched the Outreachy community page to list all projects and the skills
they required. This allowed applicants to quickly scan the list for projects that
included programming languages, tools, or skills they were interested in. Before this
change, Outreachy organizers would receive 5-10 emails each round from applicants
who were confused as to how to pick a project. Now the only emails we get are from
applicants who can't find a project that fits their needs.

The problem with listing projects is that Outreachy organizers needed to manually
update the community project list page against each participating FOSS community's page.
Just keeping the project listings up to date during the round takes approximately
10-15 hours per round.

Mentors Get Lost in On-boarding
===

A very common problem that leads to additional Outreachy organizer manual labor
is the mentor on-boarding process. Each Outreachy mentor needs to:
 - Receive a welcome email explaining how the process works and how to set a
   filter to ensure the mentor mailing list posts don't end up in the Gmail
   promotions tab
 - Be signed up for the mentors mailing list
 - Apply to be a mentor in the Outreachy application system
 - Be manually approved by the Outreachy organizers to be a mentor
 - Select their intern by navigating to the application and selecting "willing to mentor"
 - Go to their application profile and sign the mentor agreement

This manual process of mentor on-boarding and herding mentors towards the next
steps adds at least 6-10 hours per round.

We often lose mentors during the wait to be approved for the application system
by Outreachy organizers (who often have to ask coordinators about a mentor if
they aren't listed on the community landing page). This also adds additional
stress on organizers during the intern selection process, as all mentors who
want to select an intern must "claim" their intern in the application system
and sign the mentor agreement.

Projects Disappear in Six Months
===

In order for a FOSS community to participate in Outreachy, they need to have:
 - Funding for at least one intern
 - 1 coordinator
 - At least one mentor and project

There is usually six months between the first Call for Outreachy communities going out,
and when the internship starts. Projects often get completed in that time, or change
scope in such a way that it makes them unlikely to be appropriate for Outreachy interns.

Our coordinators have asked for a way to gather information on volunteers who are
willing to help guide Outreachy applicants, but may not necessarily have a project
in mind yet. Volunteers can sign up, and then coordinators can remind them closer to
the application process opening that they should submit a project.

Mentors Select Ineligible Applicants
===

Many mentors don't review applications in the system before selecting an
intern, which can lead them to select someone who isn't eligible or has
borderline time eligibility.

Applicants often fill out applications at the last minute, after working with a
mentor. We need to add a two step process: Applicants check their eligibility,
and then they start working with mentors.

We want mentors to be aware of who is eligible, so that they can focus early on
applicants who they can select as interns. We want the application system to be
something that helps mentors, not something they wrestle with at the last
minute. Adding a dashboard stating which applicants are eligible will help.

Unclear Project Descriptions Trigger Impostor Syndrome
===

There are also negative impacts to Outreachy applicants for each community
having a different landing page style.  Some project list both required and
optional skills, and other projects list skills without any indication whether
they are required or optional.  Some projects note that they'll teach
applicants and interns about a skill. 

This leads to confusion in applicants. Many Outreachy applicants have impostor
syndrome, and they won't apply for a project unless they have all the skills.
Additionally, most projects don't list what level of experience applicants need
for each skill.  This leads applicants to assume they need to be an "expert" in
a skill to apply. Many potential Outreachy applicants talk themselves out of
applying because mentors aren't clear about which skills are required,
optional, or teachable, and what skill level is needed.

Inappropriate Projects Added At the Last Minute
===

Finally, not all projects proposed by mentors are appropriate for Outreachy.

Outreachy projects need to have an established community, unlike the
student-created projects that GSoC allows. Outreachy's goal is to find open
source communities who have multiple people who can provide interns mentorship
and sponsorship. Interns learn how to work with an open source community,
rather than working solo on their own project.  An established FOSS community
provides interns networking opportunities and conferences they can attend or
speak at, which increases their chances of being hired to work on open source.
Student-created projects are unlikely to help with these goals.

The goal for Outreachy listing projects is to allow people who wouldn't
normally propose their own project to GSoC to apply for an internship. Another
requirement for Outreachy projects is that applicants must make at least one
contribution to the project (and most make many small contributions during the
application process).

Adding a new project a week or two before the application project doesn't give
enough time for all Outreachy applicants to have a fair chance at making a
contribution. Instead, late project additions are usually added for applicants
who already have connections with open source project mentors. This unduly
favors people who already have some experience contributing to open source,
which is more likely to be white, college-educated students.

We've had issues in the past with Outreachy mentors not understanding the
goals and requirements for Outreachy projects. By adding additional required
questions about the projects, Outreachy organizers can be notified of projects
that may not meet our requirements, and reject or accept those projects.

Solutions
===

This new coordinator, mentor, and volunteer on-boarding system will help these
issues by:

 - Pushing down mentor and volunteer approval from Outreachy organizers to
   community coordinators, who are in a better position to know whether the
   person should participate
 - Automatically collecting mentor and volunteer information
 - Automatically subscribing approved mentors and volunteers to the mentors
   mailing list and sending them a welcome onboarding email.
 - Providing a way for people to sign up as volunteers and proposing a project later
 - Only showing mentor and community contact information to signed in
   applicants who are eligible for this round (unless a project mentor wants to
   work with ineligible applicants)
 - Providing applicants clearer information about the skills they need to apply
 - Allowing Outreachy organizers to reject projects that aren't appropriate
   for Outreachy due to project newness, community size, or mentor inexperience
 - Forcing applicants to check their eligibility with an automated process
   before working with mentors. (goal by end of January)
 - Providing mentors with a dashboard with clear information of which
   applicants are eligible or borderline (goal by end of January)
